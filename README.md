# hello-world
This repository is for practicing GitHub and completing class assignments. 
My name is Amber, I am working on my second associates from Pima Community College. I changed my mind from Molecular Biology to Data science, and am getting some prereqs out of the way at Pima because it is less expensive than a four year restart at University.
